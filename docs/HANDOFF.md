## 2026-08-25 — Unit B — REAL Argo data + critical .gitignore fix

### 🔴 CRITICAL BUG FIXED — repo was incomplete for everyone
`.gitignore` had a bare `data/` pattern, which matches ANY directory named `data` at any depth — so
**`src/oceanembed/data/` (download_glorys, download_argo, preprocess) was NEVER committed**. A fresh clone
would die with ImportError. Patterns are now root-anchored (`/data/`, `/artifacts/*`, `/all research papers/`).
[VERIFIED] fresh `git clone` now imports every module including `data/`.
**Everyone: `git pull` — you were missing the data module.**

### ✅ REAL Argo data downloaded (no credentials needed — Argo is public)
`artifacts/argo_test.parquet`: **24,328 measurements / ~2,453 real profiles**, NIO, all 12 months of 2022.
100% inside our region; 29.0 °C @0 m → 12.2 °C @500 m; QC flags {1,2} only; no extrapolation.
(This file is gitignored — regenerate with `python -m oceanembed.data.download_argo`, ~5 min.)

### ✅ GLORYS dataset id VERIFIED (no login needed for the catalog)
`cmems_mod_glo_phy_my_0.083deg_P1D-m` — confirmed via `copernicusmarine.describe`. The **download** still
needs a free CMEMS account.

### ⚠️ DO NOT run Argo validation yet — it would be meaningless
The current `mlp_model.pt` is trained on **SYNTHETIC** GLORYS. Comparing a synthetic-trained model against
**real** Argo profiles produces garbage numbers that would look like a real result. Sequence must be:
real GLORYS download → retrain → *then* Argo validation. Unit C: build `validate_argo.py` against the
committed fixtures/structure, but do not publish metrics until the model is trained on real data.

### Environment notes (saves everyone hours)
- `erddapy<3` pinned — argopy 1.4.0 imports a symbol removed in erddapy 3.x.
- Windows SSL: `download_argo._fix_ssl()` sets `SSL_CERT_FILE` from `certifi` (ERDDAP fails otherwise).
- Verified working combo: pandas 2.3.3, xarray 2025.9.0, numpy 2.3.5, torch 2.9.1+cpu, streamlit 1.62.0.
- Regression-checked: pipeline + seam still pass after those dependency downgrades.

### NEXT
- **B (Darshan):** `copernicusmarine login` → download real GLORYS → `prepare_dataset.py --real` → retrain → real metrics.
- **A (Arjhun):** `observation_priority()` — the seam already calls it and shows the panel automatically once it exists.
- **C (Mitun+Niru):** panels (`render(recon_output, argo_df)`), `anomaly.py`, `validate_argo.py` (hold metrics until real data).

## 2026-08-25 — Unit B — Day 4: reconstruct() seam + Streamlit demo (CLICKABLE)
- WHAT WORKS [VERIFIED by execution]:
  - `inference/predict.py`: `reconstruct(lat,lon,date)` → profile_mean/std, reliability, climatology, anomaly,
    surface vars, land handling. `reconstruct_grid(date)` → temp/uncertainty/anomaly/priority (100,240,11) in ~3.6 s.
  - `app/streamlit_app.py`: launches headless, serves **HTTP 200**, clean log. streamlit 1.62.0 installed.
  - Land/no-data points correctly rejected; ocean profile 25.5 °C → 8.65 °C @500 m (physically sensible).
- ⚠️ STILL SYNTHETIC DATA — the app shows a loud SYNTHETIC banner until real GLORYS is downloaded. Do not demo as real.
- **NO-COLLISION DESIGN (important for A & C):**
  - The shell auto-detects `app/panels/<x>_panel.py::render()`. Until Unit C writes them it draws minimal fallbacks.
    **Unit C's panels slot in with zero edits to `streamlit_app.py`.** [VERIFIED: detection returns fallback today.]
  - `reconstruct_grid` returns `priority=None` until **Unit A** implements `observation_priority()`; the UI then
    shows the panel automatically. [VERIFIED: currently None, no crash.]
  - `anomaly` uses Unit C's `products/anomaly.py` when implemented, else the plain definition.
  - I did NOT touch `app/panels/*`, `products/anomaly.py`, or `products/observation_priority.py` — still A's and C's.
- ALSO FIXED: `utils.io.save_table` now deletes the other-format twin so a stale .csv can never shadow a fresh
  .parquet (pyarrow got installed, so tables are parquet now).
- NEXT (B): real CMEMS download → `prepare_dataset.py --real` → rerun slice + app for REAL numbers; DEMO_SPEC scenes.

## 2026-08-25 — Day 3 vertical slice COMPLETE (climatology + MLP + metrics + uncertainty)
- CURRENT PHASE: Day 3 — end-to-end slice runs. BRANCH: main.
- WHAT WORKS [VERIFIED by execution] — `python scripts/run_slice.py`:
  climatology baseline → MLP training (early stop) → honest 2022-test evaluation → per-depth skill →
  MC-dropout uncertainty → auto-append to docs/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md.
- IMPLEMENTED: `validation/metrics.py` (compute_metrics), `climatology.py` (build/predict),
  `models/mlp_profile.py` (torch MLP 11→128→128→11, dropout 0.2), `train/train_mlp.py` (seeded, early stop),
  `inference/uncertainty.py` (MC-dropout, 30 passes). torch 2.9.1+cpu and sklearn confirmed installed.
- ⚠️ NUMBERS ARE ON **SYNTHETIC** DATA — ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY, NOT REAL PERFORMANCE. The synthetic field is a smooth
  function of lat+season, so it is trivially learnable (R²≈0.999). **Never quote these to judges.** Real GLORYS
  numbers will be much less flattering — that is expected and fine.
- SCIENTIFICALLY ENCOURAGING [VERIFIED]: per-depth skill vs climatology DECREASES with depth
  (+0.812 @0 m → +0.145 @500 m), the physically expected pattern (surface data constrains deep temperature less).
- FINDING (uncertainty): absolute MC-dropout std SHRINKS with depth (0.214→0.029 °C). This is NOT necessarily a bug —
  deep water is naturally less variable (natural std 1.341→0.236 °C). The slice therefore reports the
  **std/natural-variability ratio** (~0.15, near-constant here) and per-depth skill as the honest diagnostics.
  RE-CHECK on real data before making any uncertainty claim.
- NEXT (A/Arjhun): LightGBM baseline + quantile uncertainty; tune MLP on REAL data; observation_priority().
- NEXT (C/Mitun+Niru): anomaly.py, validate_argo.py, UI panels; fill LITERATURE_MATRIX from the PDFs.
- NEXT (B/Darshan): real CMEMS download → `prepare_dataset.py --real` → rerun slice for REAL metrics; then
  predict.py seam + Streamlit wiring.

## 2026-08-25 — Unit B (Darshan) — Day 2 data pipeline (synthetic-verified)
- CURRENT PHASE: Day 2 (data pipeline) — logic DONE & VERIFIED on synthetic data; real CMEMS download pending creds.
- BRANCH: main
- WHAT WORKS [VERIFIED by execution]: `python scripts/prepare_dataset.py` runs synthetic GLORYS → preprocess →
  build_samples and writes real-shaped artifacts: X_train (143514,11) z-scored (mean0 std1), y_train real °C,
  X_test/y_test, meta_train/test [lat,lon,date,month,cell_id], norm_stats.json (11-len feat/targ mean/std),
  land_mask (100,240) bool. Sanity: temp 26.2°C surface → 8.7°C @500m. preprocess regrids to 100×240×11.
- BUG FOUND & FIXED [VERIFIED]: DEPTHS[0]=0 m is above GLORYS' shallowest level (~0.49 m) → linear depth-interp
  returned NaN at surface and dropped ALL rows. Fixed with depth-axis extrapolation in preprocess.run(). This
  would have hit REAL GLORYS too — caught because we tested.
- WHAT IS BROKEN / UNVERIFIED: `download_glorys.py` + `download_argo.py` NOT run here (need `pip install
  copernicusmarine argopy` + CMEMS account). GLORYS dataset_id is [INFERRED] — confirm via `copernicusmarine describe`.
- FILES ADDED: data/{download_glorys,download_argo,preprocess}.py, features/build_samples.py,
  scripts/{make_synthetic_glorys,prepare_dataset}.py.
- NEXT TASK (B): install copernicusmarine+argopy, run real download, INSPECT one file, record lat/lon/depth/units
  in DATA_CONTRACT [VERIFIED], then `python scripts/prepare_dataset.py --real`.
- NOTE for A & C: run `python scripts/prepare_dataset.py` once to get full-size artifacts to develop against
  (or use the committed `artifacts/sample_*` fixtures for quick wiring).
- BLOCKERS: none for A/C. B blocked on CMEMS credentials for REAL data only.

## 2026-08-25 — Unit B (Darshan) — scaffold seeded
- CURRENT PHASE: Day 1 (scaffold + contracts + fixtures) — DONE for the core.
- BRANCH: main
- WHAT WORKS [VERIFIED by execution]: `python src/oceanembed/config.py` OK; `python scripts/make_fixtures.py`
  writes `artifacts/sample_X.npy (500,11)`, `sample_y.npy (500,11)`, `sample_meta.csv` (lat,lon,date,month,cell_id);
  guardian checks pass (config sanity, fixture shapes, grid round-trip).
- WHAT IS BROKEN: nothing known. `pytest` + `pyarrow` + `pyyaml` not installed locally yet (tests verified inline).
- LAST CHANGE: created repo skeleton, config.py, utils (grids, io), fixtures, tests, docs, module stubs.
- FILES MODIFIED: whole initial scaffold (see git log).
- TESTS RUN: config.sanity_check + fixture shape asserts + grid roundtrip — all PASS (inline, pytest pending install).
- KNOWN ISSUES: tables fall back to CSV until `pip install -r requirements.txt` (pyarrow) — by design.
- NEXT TASK (B): GLORYS + Argo download, preprocess, build_samples → real `X/y/meta/norm_stats/land_mask/argo` files.
- NEXT TASK (A): implement `models/mlp_profile.py` + training on fixtures (stubs + signatures ready).
- NEXT TASK (C): implement `validation/metrics.py` + `climatology.py` on fixtures; seed LITERATURE/NOVELTY matrices.
- BLOCKERS: none. A and C can start immediately against `artifacts/sample_*`.
